Overview
It seems like every time Komari wakes up, she finds herself on a battlefield...but not today. This is even worseâ€”now she&#039;s in the Netherworld! Thankfully Vill, Nelia, and Estelle are with her, and the four of them join up and begin a journey into the unknown. Along the way, they meet a mysterious girl named Colette who seems to know Vill. But why would someone in another world know Komari&#039;s maid? And will Komari and her friends ever find a way back home?
