Overview
It&#039;s 1973, and Mariposa &#039;Posie&#039; Flores is a spunky, fabulous, and at times, goofy New York City club icon. The outfits she wears out clubbing are the things of legend, but when she goes flat broke, her reputation is at stake. Repeating an outfit would demolish everything she&#039;s worked towards. For a relentless and slightly (extremely) delusional woman like her? That won&#039;t do. So obviously it&#039;s time to get a credit card and go into unnecessary debt!
 
 Unfortunately, without a father, she&#039;s only got one way to get a credit card to continue dominating club floor fashion and that&#039;s through marriage. That&#039;s okay! She has four completely unaware &#039;boyfriends&#039; to choose from!
 
 After very little consideration she chooses Alexander &#039;Xander&#039; Pierceâ€” the audacious, sarcastic, and clumsy son of her boss: the mayor of NYC. Also, the only person to really realize her airheadedness is all an act. Xander is shocked by the news they were even in a relationship, but he agrees to an engagement thinking it&#039;ll please his father who&#039;s been pushing him towards a goal of becoming President of the United States. Simple goal, right? His constantly dark under eyes show how easy the burden of that aspiration been on him. To Xander, a party girl like Posie won&#039;t fit anywhere in those plans, he&#039;ll placate her to keep her from doing anything too insaneâ€” she was talking about marrying one of those random other &#039;boyfriends&#039; he&#039;s just now learning about after allâ€”and soon enough she&#039;ll run for the hills.
 
 Unbeknownst to him Posie&#039;s infatuation with him actually is genuine. She&#039;d already fallen for him long ago and she has no intentions of letting go. The credit card was simply the perfect excuse and soon enough she&#039;ll have him falling even harder for her.
