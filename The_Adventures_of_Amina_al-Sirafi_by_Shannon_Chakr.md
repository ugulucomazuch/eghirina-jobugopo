Overview
Shannon Chakraborty, the bestselling author of The City of Brass, spins a new trilogy of magic and mayhem on the high seas in this tale of pirates and sorcerers, forbidden artifacts and ancient mysteries, in one womanâ€™s determined quest to seize a final chance at gloryâ€”and write her own legend. Amina al-Sirafi should be content. After a storied and scandalous career as one of the Indian Oceanâ€™s most notorious pirates, sheâ€™s survived backstabbing rogues, vengeful merchant princes, several husbands, and one actual demon to retire peacefully with her family to a life of piety, motherhood, and absolutely nothing that hints of the supernatural. But when sheâ€™s tracked down by the obscenely wealthy mother of a former crewman, sheâ€™s offered a job no bandit could refuse: retrieve her comradeâ€™s kidnapped daughter for a kingly sum. The chance to have one last adventure with her crew, do right by an old friend, and win a fortune that will secure her familyâ€™s future forever? It seems like such an obvious choice that it must be Godâ€™s will. Yet the deeper Amina dives, the more it becomes alarmingly clear thereâ€™s more to this job, and the girlâ€™s disappearance, than she was led to believe. For thereâ€™s always risk in wanting to become a legend, to seize one last chance at glory, to savor just a bit more powerâ€¦and the price might be your very soul.
