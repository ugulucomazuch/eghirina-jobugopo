Sauron has returned. . . watch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2 on Prime Video. For the first time ever, a beautiful slipcased edition of the enchanting prelude to¬†The Lord of the Rings, illustrated throughout with over 50 sketches, drawings, paintings, and maps by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, with the complete text printed in two colors and with many bonus features unique to this edition. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey ‚Äúthere and back again.‚Äù They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon‚Ä¶ Written for J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs own children,¬†The Hobbit¬†was published on 21 September 1937. With a beautiful cover design, a handful of black &amp;amp; white drawings and two maps by the author himself, the book became an instant success and was reprinted shortly afterwards with five color plates. Tolkien‚Äôs own selection of finished paintings and drawings have become inseparable from his text, adorning editions of¬†The Hobbit¬†for more than¬†85 years. But the published art has afforded only a glimpse of Tolkien‚Äôs creative process, and many additional sketches, colored drawings, and maps‚Äîalthough exhibited and published elsewhere‚Äîhave never appeared within the pages of¬†The Hobbit. In this unique enhanced edition of Tolkien‚Äôs enchanting classic tale, the full panoply of his art is reproduced for the first time, presenting more than 50 illustrations to accompany Bilbo Baggins on his adventure ‚Äúthere and back again.‚Äù Unique to this edition are two poster-size, fold-out maps revealing all the detail of Thror‚Äôs Map and Wilderland, an illustrated 88-page booklet, and a printed art card reproducing Tolkien‚Äôs original dustjacket painting. It is additionally quarterbound in green leather, with raised ribs on the spine, stamped in three foils on black cloth boards, and housed in a custom-built clothbound slipcase. The pages are edged in gold and include a ribbon marker.
